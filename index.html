<h2>History of Japan </h2>
<p> Human habitation in Japan  can be traced all the way back to prehistoric
    times.The first known reference was  recorded in the Chinese Book of Han.
In 784 a  new capital was made, Heian-ky≈ç, modern day Kyoto. This was the
  beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until 1185. The Hein period was
  the golden  age of classical Japanese culture. From this period and on
  the Japanese religious culture was a mix of Buddhism and native religious
  practices known as Shinto. </p>
