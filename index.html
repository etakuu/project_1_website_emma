<h2>History of Japan </h2>
<p> Human habitation in Japan  can be traced all the way back to prehistoric
    times.The first known reference was  recorded in the Chinese Book of Han.
In 784 a  new capital was made, Heian-ky≈ç, modern day Kyoto. This was the
  beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until 1185. The Hein period was
  the golden  age of classical Japanese culture. From this period  on
  the Japanese religious culture was a mix of Buddhism and native religious
  practices known as Shinto. </p>

  <h3> Religion in modern day Japan </h3>
  <p2> Shinto and Buddhism are Japan's two major  religions. Shinto is as old
    as Japenese culture. Buddhism was brought to Japan from the mainland during
    the 6th century. Shinto today is a japanese term that applies to the
    religion of public shrines devoted to the worship of a number of gods(aka
    Kami). Shinto is the largest religion in Japan. About 80% of the population
    practices Shinto, only a small amount of japanese identify themselves as
    shintoists. Buddhism has been practiced in Japan since its introduction
    in 552 A.D.. In 2008 about 34% of japanese identified  as Buddhists and  <thead>
   the  number has been growing since 1990.</p>
