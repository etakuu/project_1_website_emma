    <p2> Manga is a Japanese comic book and graphic novel. Manga was first
      developed in the late  19th century. In Japan readers of manga range from
      little kids to adults. Most manga is aimed at adult audiences. Since <thead>
        1950s manga  has steadily become a major part of the Japanese publishing
        industry. A manga artist is called a  Mangaka. A Mangaka  usually works
        with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative
        editor from a commercial publishing company. If a manga becomes popular
        enough it  may be turned into an Anime. Sometimes mangas may be based off
        of  popular Animes as well.</p2>
